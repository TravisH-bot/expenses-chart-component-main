## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ReactJS
- ChartJS
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned a good amount of information using ChartJS and how to customize it to your liking. I enjoyed learning a new technology. I feel I could have achieved the hover and active effects easier using custom css and html only but I wouldn't have taken full advantage of React and the ability to import utilities such as ChartJS.

### Continued development

I plan to explore CartJS more to see if I am able to achieve simultaneous hover and active effects.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - This helped me setup the bar graph.
